# MYSTerious
World of Code Project

# Question-1:
P1) Identify the female authors? And their interests in terms of projects or programing languages?

Q1.1) Compare to the whole authors interests to avoid common interests in the public? Ex. Driveless cars is famous trend now â€“ so should not include that if more female commit code in this area. 

# Steps(P1):

1-	Fetch list of authors from the databases (git hub or bitbucket)

1.1 a2A / A2a relation from world of Code 

2-	Classify the authors based on gender (use classification model based on training data set of names/gender)

2.1 WOC assign gender based on heuristics under extended tutorial (accuracy is not good for non-western names- future work)

3-	Target group (Females): for those we need to fetch the list of projects for each.

3.1 A2p maps from woc

4-	Grouping the projects based on a theme/ Programing language. 

5-	Publish the results (themes/ Programing language.)

6-	Compare to the themes/Programing language.  of interest (hot topics). 

7-	Prepare a presentation.

Challenges
1.	Where to save intermediate data to manipulate in the next steps? 
2.	How to work on these steps parallelly ?

# Question-2
P2) Ethnicity of females to create a heat map of where the most developers are located/based?

# Steps(P2):
1-	From step 2 of P1, Classify females based on ethnicity (names/location/ time stamp) 

2-	Group authors from same location. 

3-	Display a heat map of those (numbers/location)
